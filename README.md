# Fun Website Builder Thing!

## Site Content is laid out in joel.html.pp
## HTML Compiler Stuff is in pollen.rkt

tldr: used a lot of Details/Summary HTML elements, and defined per-tag inline CSS syling as a lambda based on the depth of the current container. 
This way I can have exponentially decaying sizes of Deatils/Summary! Some margin, font size, color, and border logic in there as well.

Not doing much now that couldn't be done using % in CSS, but the concept is theoretically very expandable! I primarily just wanted to "show off my stuff" while also making a presentable website, which hopefully I accomplished!
